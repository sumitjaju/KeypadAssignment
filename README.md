Thank you for considering my application at Finra. Below are the release notes and list of pending items that could have been completed given the time. 

### Implementation notes:

- Two seperate modules for backend and front end. 
- Back end module "telephone-numbers" has spring boot api code which gives all possible alpha numeric combinations for a given phone number.
- Front end module "telephone-numbers-ui" is a UI interface built on angular 8 and bootstrap which takes the 7 or 10 digit phone number as input. 

### Release notes:

- User must enter phone number and click on confirm button.
- User must enter atleast 7 or 10 digit number for the result. 
- Upon confirm button is clicked the tabel should appear providing all lists of possible combination. 
- User should be able to paginate the table to see all phone number combinations. 

Below are few screenshots which may give you glimbs of UI. 



### Pending items:

- Unit test cases to test api. 
- Unit test cases to test service which provides the alphanumeric phone number combinations. 
- Server side pagination.
